    <p>My grandmothers are strong.<br>They followed plows and bent to toil.<br>They moved through fields sowing seed.<br>They touched earth and grain grew.<br>They were full of sturdiness and singing.<br>My grandmothers were strong.<br>My grand mothers are full of memories.<br>smelling of soap onions and wet clay <br>With veins rolling roughly over quick hands.<br> They have many clean words to say.<br>
    My grandmothers were strong .<br>Why am i not as they.<br>
